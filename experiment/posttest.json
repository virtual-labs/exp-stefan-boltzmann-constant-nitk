        "a": "8 cal/m^2/s",
        "b": "16 cal/m^2/s",

        "d": "None of the above"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "The right answer is (c). We know that the Power radiated is directly proportional to temperature to the power of 4. So, T1 = 227°C = 500K, T2 = 727°C = 1000K and P1 = 4 cal/m2/s. P2/P1 = (1000/500)^4. P2 = 64 cal/m2/s.",

      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "The right answer is (b). The heat transfer equation Q = σAT<sup>4</sup> is called Stefan-Boltzmann law. Newton's law specifies the behavior of object in motion or at rest.",
        "b": "Correct, the right answer is (b). The heat transfer equation Q = σAT<sup>4</sup> is called Stefan-Boltzmann law. This law states that the total energy radiated per unit surface area of a black body is directly proportional to the fourth power of its absolute temperature.",
        "c": "The right answer is (b). The heat transfer equation Q = σAT<sup>4</sup> is called Stefan-Boltzmann law. In the context of heat transfer, Poisson' law defines Poisson's equation is a partial differential equation that describes the distribution of heat (or variations in temperature) in a given region over time",
        "d": "The right answer is (b). The heat transfer equation Q = σAT<sup>4</sup> is called Stefan-Boltzmann law. Fourier’s Law, also known as the Law of Heat Conduction, states that the rate of heat transfer through a material is proportional to the negative gradient in the temperature and the area (perpendicular to the gradient) through which the heat flows."
