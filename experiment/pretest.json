        "a": "The right answer is (c). The unit W/m² (Watts per square meter) in heat transfer is used to represent the rate of heat flux. Heat flux, also known as thermal flux, is the rate of heat energy transfer through a given surface.",
        "b": "The right answer is (c). The unit W/m²K (Watts per square meter Kelvin) in heat transfer is used to represent the heat transfer coefficient. The heat transfer coefficient is a proportionality constant between the heat flux and the thermodynamic driving force for the flow of heat.",
        "c": "Correct, the right answer is (c). The unit W/m²K⁴ in heat transfer is used to represent the Stefan-Boltzmann constant in the Stefan-Boltzmann Law. The proportionality constant in this law is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, denoted by the Greek letter sigma (σ), and it has the value of approximately 5.67 x 10^-8 W/m²K⁴.",
        "d": "The right answer is (c). The unit W/mK (Watts per meter Kelvin) in heat transfer is used to represent thermal conductivity. It is defined as the amount of heat (in watts) transferred through a square meter of material, for each degree of temperature gradient (in Kelvin)."
